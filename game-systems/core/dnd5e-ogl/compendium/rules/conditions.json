For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks. \nAn effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effects description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creatures exhaustion level is reduced below 1.\nFinishing a long rest reduces a creatures exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also  ingested some food and drink.",
