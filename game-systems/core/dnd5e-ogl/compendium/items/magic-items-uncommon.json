The bag can hold up to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The bag weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires a Utilize action. If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Astral Plane. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents spill forth unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. The bag holds enough air for 10 minutes of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside. Placing a Bag of Holding inside an extradimensional space created by a Handy Haversack, Portable Hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within a 10-foot-radius Sphere centered on the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way and can't be reopened.",

You can take a Magic action to draw a card at random from the deck and throw it to the ground at a point within 30 feet of yourself.

The GM chooses the kind of token or determines it randomly by rolling on the Feather Tokens table. The type of token determines its rarity.\n\n**Anchor (Uncommon).** You can take a Magic action to touch the token to a boat or ship. For the next 24 hours, the vessel can't be moved by any means. Touching the token to the vessel again ends the effect. When the effect ends, the token disappears. Bird (Rare). You can take a Magic action to toss the token 5 feet into the air. The token disappears and an enormous, multicolored bird takes its place. The bird has the statistics of a Roc, but it can't attack. It obeys your simple commands and can carry up to 500 pounds while flying at its maximum speed (16 miles per hour for a maximum of 144 miles per day, with a 1-hour rest for every 3 hours of flying) or 1,000 pounds at half that speed. The bird disappears after flying its maximum distance for a day or if it drops to 0 Hit Points. You can dismiss the bird as a Magic action.\n\n**Fan (Uncommon).** If you are on a boat or ship, you can take a Magic action to toss the token up to 10 feet in the air. The token disappears, and a giant flapping fan takes its place. The fan floats and creates a strong wind. This wind can fill the sails of one ship, increasing its speed by 5 miles per hour for 8 hours. You can dismiss the fan as a Magic action.\n\n**Swan Boat (Rare).** You can take a Magic action to touch the token to a body of water at least 60 feet in diameter. The token disappears, and a 50-footlong, 20-foot-wide boat shaped like a swan takes its place. The boat is self-propelled and moves across water at a speed of 6 miles per hour. You can take a Magic action while on the boat to command it to move or to turn up to 90 degrees. The boat remains for 24 hours and then disappears. You can dismiss the boat as a Magic action.\n\n**Tree (Uncommon).** You must be outdoors to use this token. You can take a Magic action to touch it to an unoccupied space on the ground. The token disappears, and in its place a nonmagical oak tree springs into existence. The tree is 60 feet tall and has a 5-foot-diameter trunk, and its branches at the top spread out in a 20-foot radius.\n\n**Whip (Rare).** You can take a Magic action to throw the token to a point within 10 feet of yourself.

The GM chooses the kind of token or determines it randomly by rolling on the Feather Tokens table. The type of token determines its rarity.\n\n**Anchor (Uncommon).** You can take a Magic action to touch the token to a boat or ship. For the next 24 hours, the vessel can't be moved by any means. Touching the token to the vessel again ends the effect. When the effect ends, the token disappears. Bird (Rare). You can take a Magic action to toss the token 5 feet into the air. The token disappears and an enormous, multicolored bird takes its place. The bird has the statistics of a Roc, but it can't attack. It obeys your simple commands and can carry up to 500 pounds while flying at its maximum speed (16 miles per hour for a maximum of 144 miles per day, with a 1-hour rest for every 3 hours of flying) or 1,000 pounds at half that speed. The bird disappears after flying its maximum distance for a day or if it drops to 0 Hit Points. You can dismiss the bird as a Magic action.\n\n**Fan (Uncommon).** If you are on a boat or ship, you can take a Magic action to toss the token up to 10 feet in the air. The token disappears, and a giant flapping fan takes its place. The fan floats and creates a strong wind. This wind can fill the sails of one ship, increasing its speed by 5 miles per hour for 8 hours. You can dismiss the fan as a Magic action.\n\n**Swan Boat (Rare).** You can take a Magic action to touch the token to a body of water at least 60 feet in diameter. The token disappears, and a 50-footlong, 20-foot-wide boat shaped like a swan takes its place. The boat is self-propelled and moves across water at a speed of 6 miles per hour. You can take a Magic action while on the boat to command it to move or to turn up to 90 degrees. The boat remains for 24 hours and then disappears. You can dismiss the boat as a Magic action.\n\n**Tree (Uncommon).** You must be outdoors to use this token. You can take a Magic action to touch it to an unoccupied space on the ground. The token disappears, and in its place a nonmagical oak tree springs into existence. The tree is 60 feet tall and has a 5-foot-diameter trunk, and its branches at the top spread out in a 20-foot radius.\n\n**Whip (Rare).** You can take a Magic action to throw the token to a point within 10 feet of yourself. The token disappears, and a floating whip takes its place. You can then take a Bonus Action to make a melee spell attack against a creature within 10 feet of the whip, with an attack bonus of +9.

If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn't enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn't become a creature.\n\nThe creature is Friendly to you and your allies. It understands your languages, obeys your commands, and takes its turn immediately after you on your Initiative count. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions.\n\nThe creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if its creature form drops to 0 Hit Points or if you take a Magic action while touching the creature to make it revert to figurine form. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can't be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the figurine's description.\n\n**_Silver Raven (Uncommon)._** This silver statuette of a raven can become a **Raven** for up to 12 hours.

That end moves 10 feet on your turn when you first command it and 10 feet at the start of each of your subsequent turns until reaching its destination or until you tell it to stop. You can also tell the rope to fasten itself securely to an object or to unfasten itself, to knot or unknot itself, or to coil itself for carrying. If you tell the rope to knot, large knots appear at 1-foot intervals along the rope. While knotted, the rope shortens to a 50-foot length and grants Advantage on ability checks made to climb using the rope. The rope has AC 20, HP 20, and Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage. It regains 1 Hit Point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 Hit Point. If the rope drops to 0 Hit Points, it is destroyed.",

You can use an action to draw a card at random from the deck and throw it to the ground at a point within 30 feet of you.\r\n\r\nAn illusion of one or more creatures forms over the thrown card and remains until dispelled. An illusory creature appears real, of the appropriate size, and behaves as if it were a real creature except that it can do no harm. While you are within 120 feet of the illusory creature and can see it, you can use an action to move it magically anywhere within 30 feet of its card. Any physical interaction with the illusory creature reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass through it. Someone who uses an action to visually inspect the creature identifies it as illusory with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. The creature then appears translucent.\r\n\r\nThe illusion lasts until its card is moved or the illusion is dispelled.

If you play the pipes as an action, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 to 3 charges, calling forth one swarm of rats with each expended charge, provided that enough rats are within half a mile of you to be called in this fashion (as determined by the GM). If there aren't enough rats to form a swarm, the charge is wasted. Called swarms move toward the music by the shortest available route but aren't under your control otherwise. The pipes regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.\r\n\r\nWhenever a swarm of rats that isn't under another creature's control comes within 30 feet of you while you are playing the pipes, you can make a Charisma check contested by the swarm's Wisdom check. If you lose the contest, the swarm behaves as it normally would and can't be swayed by the pipes' music for the next 24 hours. If you win the contest, the swarm is swayed by the pipes' music and becomes friendly to you and your companions for as long as you continue to play the pipes each round as an action. A friendly swarm obeys your commands. If you issue no commands to a friendly swarm, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. If a friendly swarm starts its turn and can't hear the pipes' music, your control over that swarm ends, and the swarm behaves as it normally would and can't be swayed by the pipes' music for the next 24 hours.",

The GM chooses the patches or determines them randomly.\r\n\r\n| d100   | Patch                                                                                                                                                                                             |\r\n|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| 01-08  | Bag of 100 gp                                                                                                                                                                                     |\r\n| 09-15  | Silver coffer (1 foot long, 6 inches wide and deep) worth 500 gp                                                                                                                                  |\r\n| 16-22  | Iron door (up to 10 feet wide and 10 feet high, barred on one side of your choice), which you can place in an opening you can reach; it conforms to fit the opening, attaching and hinging itself |\r\n| 23-30  | 10 gems worth 100 gp each                                                                                                                                                                         |\r\n| 31-44  | Wooden ladder (24 feet long) |\r\n| 45-51 | A riding horse with saddle bags                                                                                                                                |\r\n| 52-59  | Pit (a cube 10 feet on a side), which you can place on the ground within 10 feet of you                                                                                                           |\r\n| 60-68  | 4 potions of healing                                                                                                                                                                              |\r\n| 69-75  | Rowboat (12 feet long)                                                                                                                                                                            |\r\n| 76-83  | Spell scroll containing one spell of 1st to 3rd level                                                                                                                                             |\r\n| 84-90  | 2 mastiffs                                                                                                                                                                                        |\r\n| 91-96  | Window (2 feet by 4 feet, up to 2 feet deep), which you can place on a vertical surface you can reach                                                                                             |\r\n| 97-100 | Portable ram                                                                                                                                                                                      |",

That end moves 10 feet on your turn when you first command it and 10 feet on each of your turns until reaching its destination, up to its maximum length away, or until you tell it to stop. You can also tell the rope to fasten itself securely to an object or to unfasten itself, to knot or unknot itself, or to coil itself for carrying.\r\n\r\nIf you tell the rope to knot, large knots appear at 1* foot intervals along the rope.
