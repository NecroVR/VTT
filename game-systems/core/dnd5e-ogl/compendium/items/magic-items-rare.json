All the dumped beans are destroyed in the explosion, and each creature in the Sphere, including you, makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 Force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\nIf you remove a bean from the bag, plant it in dirt or sand, and then water it, the bean disappears as it produces an effect 1 minute later from the ground where it was planted. The GM can choose an effect from the following table or determine it randomly.\n\n| 1d100 | Effect                   |\n|-------|--------------------------|\n| 01    | 5d4 toadstools sprout. If a creature eats a toadstool, roll any die. On an odd roll, the eater must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 5d6 Poison damage and have the Poisoned condition for 1 hour. On an even roll, the eater gains 5d6 Temporary Hit Points for 1 hour. |\n| 02–10 | A geyser erupts and spouts water, beer, mayonnaise, tea, vinegar, wine, or oil (GM's choice) 30 feet into the air for 1d4 minutes. |\n| 11–20 | A **Treant** sprouts. Roll any die. On an odd roll, the treant is Chaotic Evil. On an even roll, the treant is Chaotic Good. |\n| 21–30 | An animate but immobile stone statue in your likeness rises and makes verbal threats against you. If you leave it and others come near, it describes you as the most heinous of villains and directs the newcomers to find and attack you. If you are on the same plane of existence as the statue, it knows where you are. The statue becomes inanimate after 24 hours. |\n| 31–40 | A campfire with green flames springs forth and burns for 24 hours or until it is extinguished. |\n| 41–50 | Three **Shrieker Fungi** sprout. |\n| 51–60 | 1d4 + 4 bright-pink toads crawl forth. Whenever a toad is touched, it transforms into a Large or smaller monster of the GM's choice that acts in accordance with its alignment and nature. The monster remains for 1 minute, then disappears in a puff of bright-pink smoke. |\n| 61–70 | A hungry **Bulette** burrows up and attacks. |\n| 71–80 | A fruit tree grows. It has 1d10 + 20 fruit, 1d8 of which act as randomly determined potions. The tree vanishes after 1 hour. Picked fruit remains, retaining any magic for 30 days. |\n| 81–90 | A nest of 1d4 + 3 rainbow-colored eggs springs up. Any creature that eats an egg makes a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, a creature permanently increases its lowest ability score by 1, randomly choosing among equally low scores. On a failed save, the creature takes 10d6 Force damage from an internal explosion. |\n| 91–95 | A pyramid with a 60-foot-square base bursts upward. Inside is a burial chamber containing a **Mummy,** a **Mummy Lord,** or some other Undead of the GM's choice. Its sarcophagus contains treasure of the GM's choice. |\n| 96–00 | A giant beanstalk sprouts, growing to a height of the GM's choice.

The GM chooses the kind of token or determines it randomly by rolling on the Feather Tokens table.

Touching the token to the vessel again ends the effect. When the effect ends, the token disappears. Bird (Rare). You can take a Magic action to toss the token 5 feet into the air. The token disappears and an enormous, multicolored bird takes its place. The bird has the statistics of a Roc, but it can't attack. It obeys your simple commands and can carry up to 500 pounds while flying at its maximum speed (16 miles per hour for a maximum of 144 miles per day, with a 1-hour rest for every 3 hours of flying) or 1,000 pounds at half that speed. The bird disappears after flying its maximum distance for a day or if it drops to 0 Hit Points. You can dismiss the bird as a Magic action.\n\n**Fan (Uncommon).** If you are on a boat or ship, you can take a Magic action to toss the token up to 10 feet in the air. The token disappears, and a giant flapping fan takes its place. The fan floats and creates a strong wind. This wind can fill the sails of one ship, increasing its speed by 5 miles per hour for 8 hours. You can dismiss the fan as a Magic action.\n\n**Swan Boat (Rare).** You can take a Magic action to touch the token to a body of water at least 60 feet in diameter. The token disappears, and a 50-footlong, 20-foot-wide boat shaped like a swan takes its place. The boat is self-propelled and moves across water at a speed of 6 miles per hour. You can take a Magic action while on the boat to command it to move or to turn up to 90 degrees. The boat remains for 24 hours and then disappears. You can dismiss the boat as a Magic action.\n\n**Tree (Uncommon).** You must be outdoors to use this token. You can take a Magic action to touch it to an unoccupied space on the ground. The token disappears, and in its place a nonmagical oak tree springs into existence. The tree is 60 feet tall and has a 5-foot-diameter trunk, and its branches at the top spread out in a 20-foot radius.\n\n**Whip (Rare).** You can take a Magic action to throw the token to a point within 10 feet of yourself. The token disappears, and a floating whip takes its place. You can then take a Bonus Action to make a melee spell attack against a creature within 10 feet of the whip, with an attack bonus of +9. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 + 5 Force damage.\n\nAs a Bonus Action, you can direct the whip to fly up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 10 feet of the whip. The whip disappears after 1 hour, when you take a Magic action to dismiss it, or when you die or have the Incapacitated condition.\n\n|1d100|Token|Rarity|\n|---|---|---|\n|01–20|Anchor|Uncommon|\n|21–35|Bird|Rare|\n|36–50|Fan|Uncommon|\n|51–65|Swan boat|Rare|\n|66–90|Tree|Uncommon|\n|91–00|Whip|Rare|",

Each side pouch can hold up to 200 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of 25 cubic feet. The central pouch can hold up to 500 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The haversack always weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its contents. Retrieving an item from the haversack requires a Utilize action or a Bonus Action (your choice). When you reach into the haversack for a specific item, the item is always magically on top. If any of its pouches is overloaded, pierced, or torn, the haversack ruptures and is destroyed. If the haversack is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although an Artifact always turns up again somewhere. If the haversack is turned inside out, its contents spill forth unharmed, and the haversack must be put right before it can be used again. Each pouch of the haversack holds enough air for 10 minutes of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside. Placing the haversack inside an extradimensional space created by a Bag of Holding, Portable Hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate and not behind Total Cover is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.",

On a hit, the target has the Restrained condition until you take a Bonus Action to issue a command that releases it.

You can take a Magic action to unfold a Portable Hole and place it on or against a solid surface, whereupon the Portable Hole creates an extradimensional hole 10 feet deep. The cylindrical space within the hole exists on a different plane of existence, so it can't be used to create open passages. Any creature inside an open Portable Hole can exit the hole by climbing out of it. You can take a Magic action to close a Portable Hole by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Folding the cloth closes the hole, and any creatures or objects within remain in the extradimensional space. No matter what's in it, the hole weighs next to nothing. If the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole's extradimensional space can take an action to make a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. On a successful check, the creature forces its way out and appears within 5 feet of the Portable Hole. A closed Portable Hole holds enough air for 1 hour of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside. Placing a Portable Hole inside an extradimensional space created by a Bag of Holding, Handy Haversack, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate and not behind Total Cover is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.",

While the blade exists, this magic weapon functions as a Longsword with the Finesse property. If you are proficient with Longswords or Shortswords, you are proficient with the Sun Blade. You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this weapon, which deals Radiant damage instead of Slashing damage. When you hit an Undead with it, that target takes an extra 1d8 Radiant damage. Sunlight. The sword's luminous blade emits Bright Light in a 15-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 15 feet. The light is sunlight. While the blade persists, you can take a Magic action to expand or reduce its radius of Bright Light and Dim Light by 5 feet each, to a maximum of 30 feet each or a minimum of 10 feet each.",

That location becomes the point of origin of a spell or other magical effect determined by rolling on the Wand of Wonder Effects table. Spells cast from the wand have a save DC of 15. If a spell's maximum range is normally less than 120 feet, it becomes 120 feet when cast from the wand. If an effect has multiple possible subjects, the GM determines randomly which among them are affected.\n\n**_Regaining Charges._** The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll 1d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into dust and is destroyed.\n\nTable: Wand of Wonder Effects\n| 1d100 | Effect |\n|-------|--------|\n| 01–20 | You cast a spell originating from the chosen point. Roll 1d10 to determine the spell: on a **1–2,** *Darkness*; on a **3–4,** *Faerie Fire*; on a **5–6,** *Fireball*; on a **7–8,** *Slow*; on a **9–10,** *Stinking Cloud*. |\n| 21–25 | Nothing happens at the chosen point of origin. Instead, you have the Stunned condition until the start of your next turn, believing something awesome just happened. |\n| 26–30 | You cast *Gust of Wind*. The Line created by the spell extends from you to the chosen point of origin. |\n| 31–35 | Nothing happens at the chosen point of origin. Instead, you take 1d6 Psychic damage. |\n| 36–40 | Heavy rain falls for 1 minute in a 120-foothigh, 60-foot-radius Cylinder centered on the chosen point of origin. During that time, the area of effect is Lightly Obscured. |\n| 41–45 | A cloud of 600 oversized butterflies fills a 60-foot-high, 30-foot-radius Cylinder centered on the chosen point of origin. The butterflies remain for 10 minutes, during which time the area of effect is Heavily Obscured. |\n| 46–50 | You cast *Lightning Bolt*. The Line created by the spell extends from you to the chosen point of origin. |\n| 51–55 | The creature closest to the chosen point of origin is enlarged as if you had cast *Enlarge/ Reduce* on it. If the target isn't you and can't be affected by that spell, you become the target instead. |\n| 56–60 | A magically formed creature appears in an unoccupied space as close to the chosen point of origin as possible. The creature isn't under your control, acts as it normally would, and disappears after 1 hour or when it drops to 0 Hit Points. Roll 1d4 to determine which creature appears. On a **1,** a **Rhinoceros** appears; on a **2,** an **Elephant** appears; and on a **3–4,** a **Rat** appears. |\n| 61–64 | Grass covers a 60-foot-radius circle of ground, with the center of that circle as close to the chosen point of origin as possible. Grass that's already there grows to ten times its normal size and remains overgrown for 1 minute. |\n| 65–68 | An object of the GM's choice disappears into the Ethereal Plane. The object must be neither worn nor carried, within 120 feet of the chosen point of origin, and no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. If there are no such objects in range, nothing happens. |\n| 69–72 | Nothing happens at the chosen point of origin. Instead, you shrink as if you had cast *Enlarge/ Reduce* on yourself and remain in that state for 1 minute. |\n| 73–77 | Leaves grow from the creature nearest to the chosen point of origin. Unless they are picked off, the leaves turn brown and fall off after 24 hours. |\n| 78–82 | Nothing happens at the chosen point of origin. Instead, a burst of colorful, shimmering light extends from you in a 30-foot Emanation. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the Blinded condition for 1 minute. A creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. |\n| 83–87 | Nothing happens at the chosen point of origin. Instead, you cast *Invisibility* on yourself. |\n| 88–92 | Nothing happens at the chosen point of origin. Instead, a stream of 1d4 × 10 gems, each worth 1 GP, shoots from the wand's tip in a Line 30 feet long and 5 feet wide toward the chosen point of origin. Each gem deals 1 Bludgeoning damage, and the total damage of the gems is divided equally among all creatures in the Line. |\n| 93–97 | You cast *Polymorph*, targeting the creature closest to the chosen point of origin. Roll 1d4 to determine the target's new form. On a **1,** the new form is a **Black Bear;** on a **2,** the new form is a **Giant Wasp;** on a **3–4,** the new form is a **Frog.** |\n| 98–00 | The creature closest to the chosen point of origin makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature has the Restrained condition and begins to turn to stone. While Restrained in this way, the creature repeats the save at the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the effect ends. On a failed save, the creature has the Petrified condition instead of the Restrained condition. The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the *Greater Restoration* spell or similar magic. |",

The bag weighs 1/2 pound plus 1/4 pound for each bean it contains.\r\n\r\nIf you dump the bag's contents out on the ground, they explode in a 10-foot radius, extending from the beans.

The fan floats and creates a wind strong enough to fill the sails of one ship, increasing its speed by 5 miles per hour for 8 hours. You can dismiss the fan as an action.\r\n\r\n**_Swan Boat_**. You can use an action to touch the token to a body of water at least 60 feet in diameter. The token disappears, and a 50-foot-long, 20-foot* wide boat shaped like a swan takes its place. The boat is self-propelled and moves across water at a speed of 6 miles per hour. You can use an action while on the boat to command it to move or to turn up to 90 degrees.

The boat remains for 24 hours and then disappears. You can dismiss the boat as an action.\r\n\r\n**_Tree_**. You must be outdoors to use this token. You can use an action to touch it to an unoccupied space on the ground. The token disappears, and in its place a nonmagical oak tree springs into existence. The tree is 60 feet tall and has a 5-foot-diameter trunk, and its branches at the top spread out in a 20-foot radius.\r\n\r\n**_Whip_**. You can use an action to throw the token to a point within 10 feet of you. The token disappears, and a floating whip takes its place. You can then use a bonus action to make a melee spell attack against a creature within 10 feet of the whip, with an attack bonus of +9. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 + 5 force damage.\r\n\r\nAs a bonus action on your turn, you can direct the whip to fly up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 10 feet of it.

Each goat looks unique and functions differently from the others. Their properties are as follows:\\n\\n* The _goat of traveling_ can become a Large goat with the same statistics as a riding horse. It has 24 charges, and each hour or portion thereof it spends in beast form costs 1 charge. While it has charges, you can use it as often as you wish. When it runs out of charges, it reverts to a figurine and can't be used again until 7 days have passed, when it regains all its charges.\\n* The _goat of travail_ becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 30 days have passed.\\n* The _goat of terror_ becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. The goat can't attack, but you can remove its horns and use them as weapons. One horn becomes a _+1 lance_, and the other becomes a _+2 longsword_. Removing a horn requires an action, and the weapons disappear and the horns return when the goat reverts to figurine form. In addition, the goat radiates a 30-foot-radius aura of terror while you are riding it. Any creature hostile to you that starts its turn in the aura must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the goat for 1 minute, or until the goat reverts to figurine form. The frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it successfully saves against the effect, a creature is immune to the goat's aura for the next 24 hours. Once the figurine has been used, it can't be used again until 15 days have passed.",

Each side pouch can hold up to 20 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of 2 cubic feet. The large central pouch can hold up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. The backpack always weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its contents.\r\n\r\nPlacing an object in the haversack follows the normal rules for interacting with objects. Retrieving an item from the haversack requires you to use an action. When you reach into the haversack for a specific item, the item is always magically on top.\r\n\r\nThe haversack has a few limitations. If it is overloaded, or if a sharp object pierces it or tears it, the haversack ruptures and is destroyed. If the haversack is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although an artifact always turns up again somewhere. If the haversack is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, and the haversack must be put right before it can be used again. If a breathing creature is placed within the haversack, the creature can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.\r\n\r\nPlacing the haversack inside an extradimensional space created by a _bag of holding_, _portable hole_, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.",

It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.\r\n\r\nYou can use an action to unfold a _portable hole_ and place it on or against a solid surface, whereupon the _portable hole_ creates an extradimensional hole 10 feet deep. The cylindrical space within the hole exists on a different plane, so it can't be used to create open passages. Any creature inside an open _portable hole_ can exit the hole by climbing out of it.\r\n\r\nYou can use an action to close a _portable hole_ by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Folding the cloth closes the hole, and any creatures or objects within remain in the extradimensional space. No matter what's in it, the hole weighs next to nothing.\r\n\r\nIf the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole's extradimensional space can use an action to make a DC 10 Strength check. On a successful check, the creature forces its way out and appears within 5 feet of the _portable hole_ or the creature carrying it. A breathing creature within a closed _portable hole_ can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.\r\n\r\nPlacing a _portable hole_ inside an extradimensional space created by a _bag of holding_, _handy haversack_, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.",
