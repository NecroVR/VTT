# Architecture Documentation

This directory contains system architecture documentation, design decisions, and technical specifications for the VTT project.

## Purpose

Architecture documentation provides:
- High-level system design and component relationships
- Database schema and data models
- API design and integration patterns
- Technology stack decisions and rationale
- Security architecture
- Scalability and performance considerations

## Key Documents

- `SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md` - Overall system architecture and components
- `DATABASE_DESIGN.md` - Database schema, relationships, and design decisions
- Additional architecture documents as the system evolves

## Documentation Standards

- Include diagrams where appropriate (Mermaid, PlantUML, or images)
- Explain the "why" behind design decisions
- Document trade-offs and alternatives considered
- Keep documentation synchronized with code changes
- Version major architecture changes
