# Session Notes

This directory contains development session notes that track progress, decisions, and context throughout the project lifecycle.

## Purpose

Session notes provide:
- Historical record of development decisions
- Context for why certain approaches were chosen
- Progress tracking across development sessions
- Troubleshooting history and solutions
- Handoff information between sessions

## Naming Convention

Files must follow this format:
```
YYYY-MM-DD-[four-digit-session-ID]-[Topic-Description].md
```

Examples:
- `2025-12-04-0001-Initial-Setup.md`
- `2025-12-04-0002-Database-Schema-Design.md`

## What to Include

Each session note should contain:
1. **Session Summary** - Brief overview of goals and outcomes
2. **Problems Addressed** - Issues encountered and investigated
3. **Solutions Implemented** - What was built/fixed and how it works
4. **Files Created/Modified** - List with brief descriptions
5. **Testing Results** - Build status, test results, validation
6. **Current Status** - What's complete, what's in progress
7. **Next Steps** - Clear guidance for continuing work
8. **Key Learnings** - Important insights or decisions

## When to Create

- Token budget reaches 75-80%
- User explicitly requests session notes
- Context needs to be cleared
- Significant troubleshooting or investigation performed
- Major implementations completed
- End of work session
