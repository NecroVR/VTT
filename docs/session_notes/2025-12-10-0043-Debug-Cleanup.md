# Debug Cleanup Session - 2025-12-10

## Session Summary

Cleaned up debug console.log statements related to paths in the codebase that were added during development and testing.

## Objectives

- Remove debug logging from path-related files
- Keep error logging and actual error handling intact
- Ensure no useful diagnostic logging is removed

## Files Modified

### 1. `D:\Projects\VTT\apps\web\src\routes\campaign\[id]\+page.svelte`

**Removed 4 debug statements:**
- `handlePathPointAdd`: Removed 3 console.log statements
  - Debug log showing function was called with pointData
  - Debug log showing "No active scene, aborting"
  - Debug log showing "Sending pathPoint:add via websocket"
- `handlePathPointRemove`: Removed 1 console.log statement
  - Debug log showing function was called with pathPointId
- `handlePathPointUpdate`: Removed 1 console.log statement
  - Debug log showing function was called with pathPointId and updates

**Result:** Cleaner code with only the essential business logic remaining. Error handling logic preserved (early return when no active scene).

### 2. `D:\Projects\VTT\apps\web\src\lib\components\SceneCanvas.svelte`

**Removed 6 debug statements:**

**Path Tool (3 statements):**
- Removed debug log showing path tool click detection
- Removed debug log showing point creation details
- Removed debug log showing onPathPointAdd callback existence check
- Removed debug log showing path point drag start

**Wall Drawing (3 statements):**
- Removed debug log showing completeWallDrawing called with parameters
- Removed debug log showing "No wallStartPoint, returning"
- Removed debug log showing "Zero-length wall, cancelling"

**Result:** Cleaner code with business logic intact. All control flow and error handling preserved.

### 3. Path Utility Files - No Changes Needed

Checked the following files and confirmed no debug logging present:
- `D:\Projects\VTT\apps\web\src\lib\stores\paths.ts`
  - Only has proper error logging (`console.error` in catch block) and placeholder warnings for unimplemented WebSocket methods
- `D:\Projects\VTT\apps\web\src\lib\utils\pathAnimation.ts`
  - No console logging present
- `D:\Projects\VTT\apps\web\src\lib\utils\spline.ts`
  - No console logging present

## Verification

Ran multiple grep searches to confirm all path-related debug statements were removed:
- `console.log.*path` - No matches
- `console.log.*[PathTool]` - No matches
- `console.log.*[Campaign].*path` - No matches
- `console.log.*spline` - No matches

## What Was Preserved

**Kept the following (intentionally not removed):**
- Error logging in catch blocks (`console.error`)
- Warning logging for unimplemented features (`console.warn` in paths.ts for WebSocket placeholders)
- All business logic and control flow
- All error handling (early returns, validation checks, etc.)

## Summary

**Total debug statements removed: 10**
- 4 from campaign page
- 6 from SceneCanvas component

**Files checked: 5**
- 2 modified (campaign page, SceneCanvas)
- 3 verified clean (paths store, pathAnimation utils, spline utils)

All path-related debug logging has been successfully removed while preserving proper error handling and warnings for unimplemented features.

## Current Status

- All debug statements removed
- Code is cleaner and production-ready
- No loss of error handling or critical logging
- Verified no path-related debug statements remain in the codebase

## Next Steps

None required. Debug cleanup is complete.
